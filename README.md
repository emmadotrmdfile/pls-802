## README

Here I have all my data, code, and my final presentation for a grad class I took in 2024. I was trained in advanced causal inference methods using observational data.

My project focused on linking women's parlimentary representation (treatment) to a variety of trans protections (outcome) globally. 
I used weighting in R through the `WeightIt` package.
